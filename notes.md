### A
All clowns are equally likely to choose a red or blue wig.

The number of ways to choose two clowns : \binom{5}{2} = 10

There are 2^{5} possibilities to choose  clowns with two wigs. 2*2*2*2*2 = 32 .

P(exactly two clowns wearing red wigs) = \frac {10}{32} = \frac {5}{16}

### B
^{5}\textrm{C}_{5} = All clowns wear a blue wig
^{5}\textrm{C}_{4} = Only four of the clowns wear a blue wig
^{5}\textrm{C}_{3} = Three of the clowns wear a blue wig

Adding all the events and dividing by all the combinations:
\frac {^{5}\textrm{C}_{5} + ^{5}\textrm{C}_{4} + ^{5}\textrm{C}_{3}}{32} = \frac {1}{2}

Tree diagram:

50 Animals
├── 24 sheep
│   ├── 21 female
│   └── 3 male
└── 26 cattle
    ├── 20 female
    └── 6 male

Total possible selections = ^{50}\textrm{C}_{6} = 15890700
The favorable selections are choosing three males and three females.
\frac {^{24}\textrm{C}_{3} * ^{26}\textrm{C}_{3} } {^{50}\textrm{C}_{6}} = 0.331

### B
\frac {^{41}\textrm{C}_{6} * ^{9}\textrm{C}_{0}}{^{50}\textrm{C}_{6}} + \frac {^{41}\textrm{C}_{5} * ^{9}\textrm{C}_{1} }{^{50}\textrm{C}_{6}} + \frac {^{41}\textrm{C}_{4} * ^{9}\textrm{C}_{2} } {^{50}\textrm{C}_{6}} = 0.937
